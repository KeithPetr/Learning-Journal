        <p class="hero-description">
            After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career
            Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get the expert
            code reviews of my Solo Projects and meet like-minded peers.

        <p class="paragraph-title paragraph-content">How I stay committed to learning</p>
        <p class="paragraph-content">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner.
             I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to 
             create simple projects using what I learned or work new 
             techniques into existing projects.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-content">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to
             share what I was learning and most things about my 
             journey with the world.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-title paragraph-content">How I got started</p>
        <p class="paragraph-content">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal 
            site. I would take notes about what I was learning. 
            After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not 
            only reflect on what I learned but also write short 
            summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-content">That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized 
            that posting my learning summaries was also helping 
            others learn and stay motivated.</p>
